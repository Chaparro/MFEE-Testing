# MFEE Intermediate - Automation/Testing

The Intermediate MFEE Testing/Automation course is aimed at developers looking to expand their skills in a variety of domains.

In the Practitioner level, we saw an E2E solution using Webdriverio + Cucumber, applying automation testing at a high level using a publicly available demo application.

For this Intermediate learning unit, we will see more concepts about test runners and frameworks, particularly for a specialized tool that will be key in the *NodeJS* testing domain.
